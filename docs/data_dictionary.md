## Notes and Caveats

- The `trending_date` format is `YY.DD.MM`, which may require conversion to standard format.
- The dataset may contain duplicates for videos trending on multiple days.
- Some videos have missing descriptions or tags.
- `dislikes` column may no longer be accurate due to YouTube hiding public dislike counts after 2021.
